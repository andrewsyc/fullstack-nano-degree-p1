## Synopsis

A python based movie trailer website that lists theatrical movie posters with the movie title below them. Clicking on the movie poster will activate a youtube popup of the movie trailer.

Movie trailer site is responsive and uses bootstrap.

## Code Example

Movie Entry Example:
million_dollar_baby = media.Movie("Million Dollar Baby", "Boxing Movie", "http://image.toutlecine.com/photos/m/i/l/million-dollar-baby-2004-12-g.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH7gQqpw7ok")

Array of all movies to be listed:
movies = [toy_story, terminator_genisys, prometheus, the_imitation_game, the_theory_of_everything, million_dollar_baby]

Creating the html page:
fresh_tomatoes.open_movies_page(movies)


## Motivation

Excellent project for learning on. I've web developed with standard html and php, not python though.

## Installation

Running of entertainment_center.py produces a static html page called fresh_tomatoes.py

## API Reference

There are currently no 3rd party functions as of yet.

## Tests

Several instances of media class were made in the entertainment_center.py class, as each one is a movie that is displayed on the site.
Website was tested with several different browser sizes.
